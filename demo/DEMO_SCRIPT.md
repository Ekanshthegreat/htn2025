---

## 🎪 Live Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
> "What if your IDE had an AI mentor that could predict bugs before they happen, protect your flow state, and teach you better coding practices in real-time? Meet AI Debugger Mentor."

### **Demo 1: Proactive Bug Detection (2 minutes)**

1. **Open `demo/example-buggy-code.js`**
2. **Show AI Mentor panel activating**
   - "AI Mentor is now watching your code..."
   - Real-time analysis begins

3. **Navigate to line 13 (missing async/await)**
   - AI immediately highlights: "⚠️ This function calls an async method but doesn't await it"
   - Voice narration: "I notice you're calling saveToDatabase without awaiting the result"
   - Shows suggested fix with explanation

4. **Move to line 25 (undefined email bug)**
   - AI warns: "🚨 Potential null reference error - email might be undefined"
   - Explains: "This will throw an error if userData.email is undefined"

5. **Demonstrate memory leak detection (line 35)**
   - AI flags: "⚠️ Memory leak detected - setInterval without cleanup"
   - Suggests: "Consider storing interval IDs for later cleanup"

### **Demo 2: Flow State Protection (1.5 minutes)**

1. **Start typing rapidly in the editor**
2. **Show flow state detection**
   - Status indicator changes to "Flow State Detected"
   - AI minimizes interruptions
   - Focus score increases

3. **Demonstrate contextual help**
   - Place cursor on complex function
   - AI provides context-aware explanation without breaking flow
   - Voice option available but non-intrusive

### **Demo 3: Intelligent Debugging Session (2 minutes)**

1. **Click "Start Guided Debugging"**
2. **AI analyzes code and suggests strategic breakpoints**
   - "I recommend breakpoints at lines 13, 25, and 35"
   - Explains reasoning for each suggestion

3. **Voice-guided debugging**
   - Enable voice narration
   - AI walks through execution flow step by step
   - "Let's trace through the addUser function. First, we validate the user data..."

4. **Show the fixed version**
   - Open `demo/example-fixed-code.js`
   - AI explains improvements: "Here's how we can fix these issues..."

### **Demo 4: Terminal Integration (1 minute)**

1. **Open terminal and run problematic command**
   ```bash
   npm install nonexistent-package
   ```

2. **AI detects and analyzes error**
   - Real-time command analysis
   - Suggests alternatives: "Package not found. Did you mean 'existing-package'?"
   - Shows Warp integration capabilities

### **Closing Impact (30 seconds)**
> "This isn't just debugging - it's AI-powered mentorship that makes every developer better. We're not just fixing bugs; we're preventing them and teaching better practices in real-time."

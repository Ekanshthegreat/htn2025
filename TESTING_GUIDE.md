    // Expected: "Handle all error cases explicitly. Don't hide failures..."
}
```

#### **Dan Abramov** (`gaearon`):
```javascript
// Hover over React hooks
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
// Expected: "React hooks are powerful but have rules. Only call them at the top level..."

// Hover over class components
class OldUserProfile extends React.Component {
    // Expected: "Think about component composition and data flow..."
}
```

#### **Sindre Sorhus** (`sindresorhus`):
```javascript
// Hover over function exports
export function calculateDiscount() {
    // Expected: "Focus on creating small, focused, reusable modules..."
}

// Hover over imports
import lodash from 'lodash';
// Expected: "Keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained..."
```

#### **Addy Osmani** (`addyosmani`):
```javascript
// Hover over imports
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// Expected: "Consider the performance impact. Is it tree-shakeable?..."

// Hover over array methods
const result = data.map().filter();
// Expected: "Array methods create performance implications..."
```

## üîç What Makes Each Mentor Different

### Architecture Suggestions

| Mentor Type | Focus | Example Advice |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Microservices Expert** | Service boundaries | "Ensure single responsibility. Clear boundaries prevent cascading failures." |
| **Clean Architecture** | SOLID principles | "Apply SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed..." |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | Business logic | "Does this represent a clear domain concept? Align with business logic." |
| **Event-Driven** | Decoupling | "Consider event-driven patterns. Publish events instead of direct calls." |

### Styling Suggestions

| Mentor Type | Focus | Example Advice |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Functional Programming** | Pure functions | "Embrace immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions." |
| **Performance Optimization** | Efficiency | "Chaining map() and filter() creates intermediate arrays. Use reduce()." |
| **Code Style Purist** | Formatting | "Use Prettier and ESLint to enforce style automatically." |
| **Security Expert** | Vulnerabilities | "innerHTML can lead to XSS. Use textContent instead." |

### Expertise-Specific Suggestions

| Technology | Mentor Examples | Specific Advice |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **React** | gaearon, kentcdodds | "Keep hooks at top level, use custom hooks for reusable logic" |
| **Node.js** | sindresorhus, tj | "Use ES modules over CommonJS, implement error handling middleware" |
| **Testing** | kentcdodds | "Write tests first, keep functions pure and testable" |
| **Performance** | addyosmani | "Use Promise.all() for parallel operations, avoid await in loops" |

## üß™ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Test Tone Variations

Create mentors with different `feedbackApproach` values and notice how the same advice is delivered differently:

- **Direct** (torvalds): "This function is doing too much. Split it up."
- **Analytical** (gaearon): "Consider the single responsibility principle here..."
- **Encouraging** (kentcdodds): "Great start! You might consider breaking this into smaller functions..."
- **Pragmatic** (sindresorhus): "For maintainability, consider splitting this function..."

### 2. Test Context Awareness

The same code pattern will trigger different advice based on:
- **File complexity**: Simple files get encouragement, complex files get refactoring advice
- **Number of dependencies**: Many imports trigger architecture advice
- **Code patterns**: React patterns trigger React-specific advice

### 3. Test Expertise Combinations

Some mentors have multiple expertise areas:
- **React + Performance**: Will give React advice with performance considerations
- **Testing + Security**: Will suggest tests that cover security scenarios
- **Node.js + Microservices**: Will give backend advice with distributed systems perspective

## üé® Visual Indicators

Look for these visual patterns in the suggestions:

### Icons by Tone:
- üåü **Encouraging**: Positive, supportive advice
- üéØ **Direct**: Straight to the point

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you don't see personalized suggestions:

1. **Check active mentor**: Ensure you have a GitHub-based mentor active
2. **Verify profile creation**: Make sure the GitHub profile was analyzed successfully
3. **Check hover timing**: Wait a moment for the analysis to complete
4. **Try different patterns**: Some mentors specialize in specific areas

### If suggestions seem generic:

1. **Create new mentor**: Try a different GitHub username
2. **Check expertise**: Some profiles may have limited detectable expertise
3. **Test specific patterns**: Try the exact code patterns mentioned in this guide
